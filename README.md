# T1_Mapping_Demo
 **Code: Quantitatives T1 Mapping und T1-H2O Korrelationsimaging bei 0.35 Tesla
 This project contains all the code content in my Bachelor-thesis.
 The code is used as follows:
  
 1. Each processing step is divided into separate m files, so they are each with an initials. The operation should be done in alphabetical order.
 2. Each m file defines the input and output parts at the beginning, and you can freely define the source of the input path and the file name of the output.
 3. The data generated by some m files may be a prerequisite for another m file to run. The required file and the source path of the file are indicated in the comment.
